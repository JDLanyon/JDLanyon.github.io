# Parallel Processing Analysis — Marching Cubes

A technical exploration of parallel processing techniques applied to the **Marching Cubes** algorithm, developed as part of **CAB401** at QUT. This project benchmarks and analyses performance gains achieved through GPU-accelerated parallel computation versus traditional serial implementations.

## Overview

The Marching Cubes algorithm is a computer graphics technique for extracting a polygonal mesh from an implicit surface (scalar field). This project implements and compares multiple approaches:

- **Serial CPU Implementation** — Baseline single-threaded execution
- **Multi-threaded CPU Implementation** — Parallelised across CPU cores using work partitioning
- **GPU Compute Implementation** — Shader-based parallel execution on the GPU

## Key Objectives

- Measure and analyse performance scaling across different input sizes
- Compare execution time and resource utilisation across serial, multi-threaded, and GPU approaches
- Identify bottlenecks and optimal parallelisation strategies for volumetric mesh generation
- Document trade-offs between implementation complexity and performance gains

## Built With

- **Unity** — Visualisation and 3D rendering environment
- **C#** — CPU-based algorithm implementation and benchmarking framework
- **Compute Shaders** — GPU-based parallel execution using HLSL
- **Unity Profiler** — Performance measurement and bottleneck analysis

## Applications

Understanding parallel Marching Cubes has direct applications in:
- **Medical Imaging** — MRI/CT scan volume visualisation
- **Scientific Visualisation** — Fluid dynamics and meteorological data rendering
- **Game Development** — Procedural terrain and organic shape generation
- **VFX** — Volumetric effects and simulation rendering
