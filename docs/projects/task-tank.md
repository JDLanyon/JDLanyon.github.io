# Task Tank - Gamified Task Manager

**Task Tank** is a cross-platform productivity-focused study application developed by a team of 6 as part of CAB302 - Software Development at Queensland University of Technology (QUT). The project turns task management into an engaging experience by combining a Pomodoro study timer, task tracking, and a virtual fish tank where completing work earns in-game rewards.

> *"Being students ourselves - we've all got heaps to do, and procrastination is always a thing we struggle with. Other to-do apps can be overly complex or feel like work, so we wanted something that makes you want to come back."*

## Core Features

- **Pomodoro Study Timer** - Customizable segment durations with health reminders, sound effects, and points earned upon session completion
- **Task Tracking** - Add, delete, edit tasks; mark tasks as priority and sort by priority level; earn points upon task completion
- **In-game Store & Tank** - Purchase fish and decorations for your tank; animated fish and decorations with real-time rendering
- **User Accounts** - Local SQL database with password hashing for secure profile persistence

## Technical Architecture

- **DAO Factory Pattern** - Instantiates complex objects cleanly, separating data handling from business logic
- **Singleton Methods** - Tracks singular instances such as the SQLite connection
- **Data Access Objects (DAO)** - Decouples data persistence from application logic
- **OOP Principles** - Inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and encapsulation ensure scalable and modular development
- **JavaFX FXML** - UI written in `.fxml` for clean separation of layout and logic
